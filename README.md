- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheDzashe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything really. Jack of all trades, master of many. Programming, art, music, film, sport. You name it, I probably love it!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: In 3rd grade, everyone in my class (including my teacher), made a song called "Mrs Chatter-box" about me. I would tell you how it went but that would be proving their point.
